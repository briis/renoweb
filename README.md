## NEW INTEGRATION 'AFFALDSHÅNDTERING DK' IS REPLACING THIS INTEGRATION

As of today (2024-03-05) the development of this integration has stopped. The API it is using is being phased out, and more and more Municipalities, stop working.
But don't worry, a replacement is now Live, that even supports some of the Municipalities not previously supported. At this point in time, I have found that 47 Municipalities work with the new integration. Where this integration now is down to 32 municipalities.

So DO NOT INSTALL this integration, instead go to [Affaldshåndtering DK](https://github.com/briis/affalddk) and follow the instructions to install and/or upgrade from Renoweb.


## INTRODUCTION

The renoweb integration adds support for collecting Garbage Collection data from RenoWeb. This is a data provider for several Municipalities in Denmark.
